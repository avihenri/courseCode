Thinking About Errors in Your Code Differently

    Errors in your code mean you’re trying to do something cool
        - The more code you write the more errors you will encounter
        - Site reliability engineer = finds errors in web platforms
        - Test engineer - creates automated tests to discover errors

    Tools to tackle code errors
        - The steps are mostly a combination of reading the error carefully or copy pasting it in a Google search!
            1. Dissect the error.
                - Find the line the error is on
            2. Ask yourself, is the solution in the error?
                - Sometime you get syntax errors which shows what is missing
            3. Search for other people who have encountered this error.
                - Delve a little deeper if not syntax error
                - Copy and paste the error into google to see how other people dealt with it
                - Stack Overflow is you buddy
            4. Compare their use case to yours.
                - You might find someone is doing something different but gets the same error
                - Compare their code with yours
            5. Try to implement the solution.
                - try the solution out to see if it fixes the error - if not keep trying new things
            6. If it doesn’t work, repeat steps 2-4.
