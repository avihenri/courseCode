    Bash Profile
        nano ~/.bash_profile
        bash profile is commonly called this 
            when session starts - it loads the contents of the bash profile before executing commands
        ~ represents the user's home directory
        . indicates hidden files
        ~/.bash_profile - is important since the cmd line recognises the bash profile
        source ~/.bash_profile - activates the changes in the file for the session

        nano ~/.bash_profile - added this in the file - alias pd="pwd"
        source ~/.bash_profile 
        pd = does the same as pwd

    Aliases I
        alias pd="pwd" - create keyboard shortcuts
            now pd will do the same as pwd
        source ~/.bash_profile - makes pd available in the current session

    PS1
        variable that defines the makeup style of the cmd line]
        export PS1=">> " - changes $ to >>
        source to make it available

    env
        cmd env = returns list of env variables


ENVIRONMENT
Generalizations
Congratulations! You learned to use the bash profile to configure the environment. What can we generalize so far?

The environment refers to the preferences and settings of the current user.

The nano editor is a command line text editor used to configure the environment.

~/.bash_profile is where environment settings are stored. You can edit this file with nano.

environment variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs and hold information about the environment.

export VARIABLE="Value" sets and exports an environment variable.
USER is the name of the current user.
PS1 is the command prompt.
HOME is the home directory. It is usually not customized.
PATH returns a colon separated list of file paths. It is customized in advanced cases.
env returns a list of environment variables.
