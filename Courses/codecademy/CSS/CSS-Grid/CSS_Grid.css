/* CSS GRID ESSENTIALS
Introduction to Grids */

    /*
    - The grid can be used to lay out entire web pages. 
    - Whereas Flexbox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, 
        CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts, providing many tools for aligning and 
        moving elements across both rows and columns.
    */

    /* Creating a Grid */
    /* To set up a grid, you need to have both a grid container (parent) and grid items (children). */
        /* To turn an HTML element into a grid container, you must set the element’s display property 
            to grid (for a block-level grid) or inline-grid (for an inline grid). */
            .grid {
                display: grid; /* required */
                border: 2px blue solid;
                width: 400px;
                height: 500px;
              }
    
    /* Creating Columns - grid-template-columns */
        /* By default, grids contain only one column. If you were to start adding items, 
        each item would be put on a new row; that’s not much of a grid! To change this, 
        we need to explicitly define the number of rows and columns in our grid.  */
        .grid {
            display: grid;
            width: 500px;
            grid-template-columns: 100px 200px; 
            /* 1st creates no of colms, 2nd width of each colum, this is two cols 1st @ 100px & 2nd @ 200px */
          }
          /* Percentages */
          .grid {
            display: grid;
            width: 1000px;
            grid-template-columns: 20% 50%; /* precent of the width 1000px */
          }
          /* mix and match */
          .grid {
            display: grid;
            width: 100px;
            grid-template-columns: 20px 40% 60px; /* 3 cols = bigger than width */
          }

    /* Creating Rows - grid-template-rows */ 
    /* This property is almost identical to grid-template-columns. Take a look at the code below to see both properties in action. */
        .grid {
        display: grid;
        width: 1000px;
        height: 500px;
        grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;
        grid-template-rows: 10% 20% 600px;
        }
        /*
        This grid has two columns and three rows. 
        grid-template-rows defines the number of rows and sets each row’s height. 
        In this example, the first row is 50 pixels tall (10% of 500), the second row is 100 pixels tall (20% of 500), 
        and the third row is 600 pixels tall. */

    /* Grid Template - grid-template */
        /* for both columns and rows */
        .grid {
            display: grid;
            width: 1000px;
            height: 500px;
            grid-template: 200px 300px / 20% 10% 70%; /* before slash is row and after is cols */
          }
