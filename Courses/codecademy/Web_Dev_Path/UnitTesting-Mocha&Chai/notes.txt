Introduction to Testing with Mocha and Chai
======================================================================================
Mocha and Chai, Test Suites and Test Cases
- Mocha and Chia are JS frameworks for unit Testing
- Mocha uses reg exp - describe & it 
    - These keywords provide structure ti tests by batching them into suites & cases 
    - test suite - collection of tests relating to a single function or behaviour
        - batched underneath the describe keyword 
    - test case/unit tests - is a single description about the code that either passes or fails 
        - batched under it keyword
    - Mocha also has tools for cleaning the state of software being tested 
        - this insures test cases are being run independently of each other
        - independence of test cases means an error can be pin pointed more quickly

Assertions
- Assertions are the base components of test cases
- tied to particular values & will fail if expected value does not match
- all need to be met for the test to pass 
- Chai is an assertion library
    - often used alongside Mocha
    - provides funcs & methods to help compare outputs of certain tests with its expected values 
    - example: expect(exampleArray.to.have.lengthOf(3));
        - this checks if the array is a length of 3 or not 

Failing & Passing Tests 
- You need to make sure a test fails when it should

Reading Tests with Mocha and Chai
======================================================================================
Example test:
describe('setPlayerMoves() - Main Functionality', function() { // this is a `describe` block, everything within this callback function is one test suite
  afterEach(clearMoves); // this is a `hook` that gets called between `it` blocks to reset the state

  it('a function called setPlayerMoves should exist', function() { // this is an `it` block, everything inside this function is a single test case
    should.equal(typeof setPlayerMoves, 'function'); // tests often start by checking that the right things exist and are of the right type
  });

  it('should set player one\'s moves with valid inputs', function() {
    setPlayerMoves('Player One', 'rock', 11); // here we call a function from the code we are testing that sets play one's move to rock with a value of 11

    should.equal(playerOneMoveOneType, 'rock'); // this is an assertion that tests that after the `setPlayerMoves()` function above is called, playerOneMoveOneType should equal `rock`
    should.equal(playerOneMoveOneValue, 11); // this assertion tests that setPlayerMoves can set the value of playerOneMoveOneValue
  });
})

Test Suites 
Tests for one feature are grouped together in describe blocks. This group of tests, called a test suite, describes the “Main Functionality” of the setPlayerMoves function. 
Describe takes a string and a callback function: the string describes the feature or behavior being tested, and the callback function contains all of the code for the 
different tests being run.

You’ll see that inside the describe block, the afterEach function is called. This is called a hook, or a function that is called at certain points in the lifecycle of 
the process that it is running in. The afterEach function gets called right after each it block is run, and customizing this function allows us to reset things that we 
want to reset between different tests.

Here we call the function clearMoves which is a helper function that sets all of the moves back to undefined. It is written outside of any of the blocks, but used as a 
hook in many of them.

function clearMoves() {
  playerOneMoveOneType = undefined;
  playerOneMoveOneValue = undefined;
  playerTwoMoveOneType = undefined;
  playerTwoMoveOneValue = undefined;
}

Test cases
Each it block describes more particular behavior to test. In the first it block, we test that setPlayerMovesactually exists and that it is a 
function so that it can correctly be used in the next block.

In the second it block, we call the function setPlayerMoves, which is a function from the code that we are testing from our Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
 After setPlayerMoves is called with the arguments, the variable playerOneMoveOneType should be equal to the string ‘rock’ and playerOneMoveOneValue should be equal to the number 11.

Assertions
Any individual assertion where we are comparing the actual and expected values can be called an assertion. The words should, expect, and assert in the
 tests indicate that an assertion is being made.

Each it block test includes multiple assertions, because there are multiple scenarios and edge cases that we want to test for. The error messages that
 you get from failed tests will most likely point to one of these assertions.

Onwards
Those are the basics of reading tests! Learn more from the mocha and chai documentation.

Even if you encounter tests written with a different framework or for a different language, the same principles of writing good independent unit tests still apply.

Also, checkout the article on reading test ouput so that you can interpret the output of tests and turn it into an action plan for fixing your code!
