global.process = info about current processes like task manager
process.env = stores & controls info about the environment 
e.g = it contains PWD property which holds a string of the directory the process is located
	web app may might perfrom different tasks tan if it is live so
	we could store this info in process.env
	1. could add property to process.env = NODE_ENV	 with value of either production or development
	if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'){
  	console.log('Testing! Testing! Does everything work?');
	}
process.memoryUsage() - returns info on CPU of current process (return example below)
	{ rss: 26247168,
 	 heapTotal: 5767168,
 	 heapUsed: 3573032,
 	 external: 8772 }
	heap = means different things - specific data structure, block of memory
	process.memoryUsage().heapUsed = returns bytes of memory for current process
process.argv - holds an array of cmd line values provided when process was initiated
	first array el = path to Node
	second array el = path to file thats running
	following el = any cmd line arguments provided 
	(eg. node myProgram.js testing several features)
	console.log(process.argv[3]); // Prints 'several'
