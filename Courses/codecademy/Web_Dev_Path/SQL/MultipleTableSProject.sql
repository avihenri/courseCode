-- SQL AND DATABASES FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT
-- Multiple Tables with REBU
-- Letâ€™s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

-- Suppose you are a data analyst at REBU, a ridesharing platform. 
-- For a project, you were given three tables:

-- trips - trips information
-- riders - users data
-- cars - autonomous cars

SELECT * FROM trips;

SELECT * FROM riders;

SELECT * FROM cars;

SELECT riders.first,
   riders.last,
   cars.model
FROM riders, cars;

SELECT *
from trips
LEFT JOIN riders
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

SELECT *
FROM trips
INNER JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

 SELECT * 
 FROM riders
 UNION
 SELECT * 
 FROM riders2;

SELECT round(avg(cost), 2)
FROM trips;

SELECT * 
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM cars
WHERE status = 'active';

SELECT * 
FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC
limit 2;
