    Your mission is to construct a single-page website that plays a fully-functional game. 
    You will see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact harmoniously to produce a dynamic website.

    Follow the link below to see what your game will look like by the end of this project. 
    Play a few rounds and see how you fare against the ChoreBot:

    Chore Door

    Believe it or not, you have the capabilities of building every feature in this game - 
    from the layout to the logic. Be patient, take creative risks, and most importantly, have fun!
