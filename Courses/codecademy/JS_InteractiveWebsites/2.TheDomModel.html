    DOM - Document Object Model
 -->

<!-- 
        Powerful tree like structure - allows us to conceptualise hierarchy & access the elements on a web page
        The DOM is a logical tree-like Model that organizes a web page’s HTML Document as an Object.
            Note: There are other types of documents, such as XML and SVG, that are also modeled as DOM structures.
     -->

<!-- 
         DOM is like a family tree - made up of family members & relationships
         In data science a family member would be called a node
         We define a node as an intersecting point in a tree that contains data.
         In the DOM tree the top-most node is called the root node & descendants are the HTML Tags in the document
      -->
<html>

<head>
    <title></title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1></h1>
    <div>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
    </div>
</body>

</html>

<!-- 
          PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS IN THE DOM
            Parent node - closest connected node to another node towards the root
            Child node - closest connected node to another node away from the root

       -->
        document (root) 
        html 
        head (parent of title) - body (parent of most of document) 
        title (child of head) - h1 - div (child of body)

            Congratulations on completing our introduction to the Document Object Model, or DOM, as a structure!

            Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

            The DOM is a structural model of a web page that allows for scripting languages to access that page.
            The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document.
            Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements.
            The DOM also allows access to the regular attributes of an HTML element such as its style, id, etc.
            With this understanding, you can begin to leverage the power of scripting languages to create, update, and maintain webpages!

JAVASCRIPT AND THE DOM
The document keyword
 -->

    <!-- 
       The document object in JS is the door to the DOM structure 
       The document allows us to access the root node of the DOM
       you can access with the keyword - document.body will access the body of the document
       List of the keywords - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document
    -->

    <!-- 
        Tweak an Element
            To access & set the content of an element - .innerHTML            
     -->
     <script>document.body.innerHTML = 'The cat loves the dog.';</script>
     <!-- You can also add HTML formatted elements -->
     <script>document.body.innerHTML = '<h2>This is a heading</h2>'; </script>


    <!-- 
        Select and Modify Elements
            .querySelector() =  allows us to access the CSS selector & returns the first matching element            
    -->
    <script>document.querySelector('p');</script>
    <!-- 
        or get by ID
     -->
     <script>document.getElementById('bio').innerHTML = 'The description';</script>


     <!-- 
         Style an element
            .style = allows access to the inline style of a tag
            format = element.style.property (property = css)
      -->
      <script>
        let blueElement = document.querySelector('.blue');
        blueElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';

        document.querySelector('.blue').style.fontFamily = Roboto;
      </script>


      <!-- 
          Create and Insert Elements
            .createElement(tagName) = creates a new element (does not append to the document, it creates an empty element with no inner HTML)
            To add it to the webpage - assign it to be a child of an element - .appendChild()
       -->
       <script>
           let paragraph = document.createElement('p');
            paragraph.id = 'info'; 
            paragraph.innerHTML = 'The text inside the paragraph';
            document.body.appendChild(paragraph);
       </script>


       <!-- 
           Remove an Element
            .removeChild() - removes element from child
            .hidden = hides element - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/hidden

    Review
In this lesson, you manipulated a webpage structure by leveraging the Document Object Model interface in JavaScript.

Let’s review what we learned:

The document keyword grants access to the root of the DOM in JavaScript
The DOM Interface allows you to select a specific element with CSS selectors by using the .querySelector() method
You can also access an element directly by its ID with .getElementById()
The .innerHTML and .style properties allow you to modify an element by changing its contents or style respectively
You can create, append, and remove elements by using the .createElement(),.appendChild() and .removeChild() methods respectively
The .onclick property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event
