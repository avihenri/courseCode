// Make a keyless car!
// This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:


// using prompt() and alert(), ask a user for their age.
// IF they say they are below 18, respond with:
// "Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off"

// IF they say they are 18, respond with:
// "Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!"

// IF they say they are over 18, respond with:
// "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"



My answer was wrong due to the order and I put equal or greater than for the first if statement -
var age = prompt("What is your age?");

if (Number(age) < 18) {
	alert("Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off");
} else if (Number(age) > 18) {
	alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");
} else if (Number(age) === 18) {
	alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");
}
var age = prompt("What age are you?");

if (Number(age) => 18) {
    alert(" Sorry. you canny drive. Power off");
} else if (Number(age) === 18) {
alert(" Congrats on your first year driving. Enjoy the ride");
} else {
alert("Power on, enjoy the ride!");
};
